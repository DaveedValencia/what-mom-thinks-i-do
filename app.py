1. What my mom thinks I do:
Create a brief, funny quote (20-30 words) with emoji ðŸ§“ from a loving boomer mom who's not tech-savvy but tries to understand. Use slightly outdated references, genuine pride, and practical concerns about benefits/stability.

2. What my friends think I do:
Create a brief, funny quote (20-30 words) with emoji ðŸ’» that shows how friends typically overestimate or misunderstand the job's prestige, salary, or excitement.

3. What I think I do:
Write a brief, empowered self-perception statement (20-30 words) with emoji ðŸ§  using industry jargon and confidence.

4. What I actually do:
Create a humorous reality check (20-40 words) with emoji ðŸ”¥ describing mundane, frustrating, or absurd actual day-to-day tasks of the job.

Format exactly like this example with proper line breaks between each section and bold headers:
**What my mom thinks I do:**
ðŸ§“ "Are you still doing tech support?"

**What my friends think I do:**
ðŸ’» "He's probably making bank with some crypto startup."

**What I think I do:**
ðŸ§  Mastermind of logistics, automation, and digital domination.

ðŸ”¥ Fix broken discount codes at 11 PM while refreshing FedEx tracking and eating dinner over a Slack huddle."""},
