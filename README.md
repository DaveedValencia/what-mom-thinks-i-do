# What Mom Thinks I Do 🔥

A meme-style AI app that hilariously breaks down what you *think* your job is… and what your mom *thinks* you do instead.

Built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI GPT-4o**, it returns a four-part comedy breakdown of your job title:
- What your mom thinks you do
- What your friends think you do
- What you think you do
- What you actually do

---

## 🤹 Example Output

- **What my mom thinks I do:**  
  🧓 "Are you still doing tech support?"

- **What my friends think I do:**  
  💻 "He's probably making bank with some crypto startup."

- **What I think I do:**  
  🧠 Mastermind of logistics, automation, and digital domination.

  🔥 Fix broken discount codes at 11 PM while refreshing FedEx tracking and eating dinner over a Slack huddle.
